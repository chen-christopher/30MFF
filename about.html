Despite COVID-19 deeply affecting all of us, we can still find joy and meaning in everyday events. Even the smallest things can leave lasting impressions. <br><br>This film celebrates both our differences and our similarities. With <i>Pass It On</i>, we aim to highlight how we can come together to create even when physically apart.
